And I have completely enjoyed tuning into her blog for years (like, so many years now!) for a dose of real-life inspiration and lovely prose.  Her posts on navigating motherhood (with her sweet little toddler) and marriage have always been some of my favorites.  But I have always especially connected with her posts on work, and creativity, and self-care, probably because they’re always words I need to take to heart myself.  I also really admire how brave and open she has been to letting her career evolve/change in some big ways over the past decade, and I can’t wait to follow along wherever the next roads may lead.",

Her posts are always interesting and fun, and I look forward to her list of links every weekend.  Also of note — she has really awesome readers, so the comment sections on her posts are usually just as fascinating to read as well.",

      "body": " I have been following Elise’s blog since before I even knew what a blog was. (Yeah, way back before blog readers, she was a favorite “bookmark” in my browser!)  And in that weird way that the internet brings people together, I kind of feel like we’ve “grown up together” over this past decade.  It’s been fun to watch her transition from life as a single graphic designer to falling in love and getting married, having one daughter and then another, taking the leap from one creative endeavor to another to another — and sharing stories and reflections and photos of it all on her blog along the way.  I just really dig the way she thinks about and appreciates life, and love her style.  Now if only I could make myself finish a scrapbook…",

      "body": " I had always heard people talk about this blog, but didn’t start following regularly until a year or two ago.  I’ll be the first to admit that fashion-ish blogs aren’t usually my thing, but I feel like Emily is really down-to-earth, and posts about trendy things in a fun and helpful and accessible way.  Her beauty tutorials are also always fascinating and spot-on.  More than anything though (I’m realizing a theme here…), I love the posts when she shares about her husband, and all of the honest ups and downs of navigating life as a new mom.",

They definitely know the sort of topics people are searching for, and keep a nice balance of everything personal and professional, and aspirational yet accessible",
